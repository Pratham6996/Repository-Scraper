# GitHub Repository Scraper 

This Python script scrapes GitHub repositories and extracts relevant information such as the repository name, username, star count, and the URL to the repository. The extracted data is stored in an Excel file.

## Features

- Scrapes multiple pages of repositories on GitHub.
- Extracts repository details including username, repository name, star count, and URL.
- Saves the data into a well-structured Excel file.
- Automatically handles pagination to scrape data from multiple pages.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the scraper locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- Required Python libraries: `requests`, `pandas`, `beautifulsoup4`, `lxml`

## Languages and Technologies

This project involves scraping repositories related to the following languages and technologies:

- **Java**: The primary focus of the scraper, used to extract data about Java-related repositories.
- **Data-V**: A visualization library often used with data processing tools.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python used for web development.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for APIs, allowing clients to request only the data they need.
- **JSON**: A lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write.
- **JavaScript**: A programming language commonly used for web development.
- **Machine Learning**: Techniques and algorithms used for predictive modeling and data analysis.
- **PostgreSQL**: An advanced open-source relational database management system.
- **Python**: The programming language used to write the scraper.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.


### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-scraper-java.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd repository-scraper-java

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas beautifulsoup4 lxml

## Usage

To scrape GitHub repositories related to Java and save the data to an Excel file:

1. **Run the Java script**:
   ```bash
   Java.py

### Script Functionality

- The script fetches HTML content from multiple pages of the Java topic on GitHub.
- It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract repository details.
- Details extracted include:
  - **Username**: The GitHub username of the repository owner.
  - **Repository name**: The name of the repository.
  - **Stars**: The number of stars the repository has.
  - **URL**: The URL to the repository.
- The data is compiled into a pandas DataFrame.
- The DataFrame is cleaned and reformatted as needed.
- Finally, the DataFrame is saved into an Excel file named `Git_Pro_E2S_Java.xlsx`.

## Built With

- Python
- BeautifulSoup4 - For web scraping
- Requests - For handling HTTP requests
- Pandas - For data manipulation and exporting to Excel
